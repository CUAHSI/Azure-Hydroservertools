HydroServer Redesign Part 18


**** Summary ****
 - QA bug fix for WDC-1578



**** HydroServerTools/Views/CSVUpload ****
 - DragAndDropFiles.cshtml
   - function deleteListItem(...) 
     - conditionalize 'delete' file calls to server on a non-null current upload id
   - function $(document).ready(...)
     - 'Change' event handler for file input element
        - reset input's value to support multiple entries of the same file path and name...



Also - to prevent a run-time error - commented out '_CountInTables' references in SelectUploadType.cshtml
