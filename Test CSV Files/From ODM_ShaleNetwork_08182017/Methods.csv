The approach used to estimate mean areal precipitation (MAP) for each of the MOPEX basins is essentially the same as used for gauge-only MAP estimation in the National Weather Service River Forecast System (NWSRFS). The undelying interpolation procedure uses an inverse distance algorithm. The MAP procedure can be found in the MOPEX US Data Documentation. The link is included. ,ftp://hydrology.nws.noaa.gov/pub/gcip/mopex/US_Data/Documentation/US%20MOPEX%20Data%20Set%2020060612.pdf,Mean_Areal_Precip
"The procedure to estimate mean areal temperature involved first estimating mean areal maximum and minimum daily temperature. Then if temperature values during the day are needed, the procedure suggested by Parton and Logan (1981) to estimate hourly tempertures from daily maximum and minimum was used.
